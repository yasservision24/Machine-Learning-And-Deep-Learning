# linear-regression-based-prediction-for-malignant-and-benign-for-breast-tumor
 This is the Assignment for the course Cell Biology and Biochemistry done in the third semester at the IIITD(Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology Delhi).

The assignment uses the R language to make the linear regression based prediction for malignant and benign for breast tumor.

The dataset is taken from the University of California,Irvine Machine Learning Repository.   https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/17/breast+cancer+wisconsin+diagnostic

Columns 3-32 are used for making the linear regression based prediction.

Features name for each Column can be seen on the dataset.

The Histogram and Density Plot is plotted using the Column 4 , i.e. Texture.

The Violin plot is plotted using the Columns 4-8. i.e. Texture1,Perimetre1,Area1,Smoothness1,Compactness1.
