# Breast-tumor-classification-using-deeplearning

This repository contains a deep learning model for predicting breast tumor as Benign or Malignant using a dataset with 30 features. The model has been trained using a deep neural network and is capable of making binary predictions (0 or 1) based on the provided input features. 0 for Benign And 1 for Malignant tumor

The dataset used for training and evaluating the model is taken from sklearn dataset
