# Skin-Cancer-Binary-Classifiaction-using-CNN
This dataset is a collection of JPEG files containing either cancerous or non-cancerous skin images. This dataset is perfect for binary classification. Each class, either cancerous or non-cancerous, is split into training and testing sets. The user can either use this default split, or he or she can use their own train-test split ratio.
